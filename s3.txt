S3 : Simple Storage Service : Object based storage solution. 

Object based storage : We can store flat files. : S3
Block Based storage : We can install the applications and run OS. : EBS, Instance Store
Storage over the network : SAN/NAS : Storage device runs over the network, can be accesable from multiple resources. : EFS, FSx

--> We store all the data in Buckets. 
--> Defaultly we can create 100 buckets in an aws account. (Soft Limit)
--> Bucket Naming standards
	--> Min Char 3 , Max 63 char
	--> Should not contain Upper case letter, Special charater
	--> Should not start with . / end with . / no ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
--> S3 is a global service, Does not required region selection. (IAM also global service)
--> We have unlimited storage in s3.
--> We can upload objects into the bucket.
--> Min Object size : 0 bytes.. Max Object size : 5 TB

How to make data publicly accesable.

Block Public Access settings for this bucket : True


Tags : 
Name : 
Application : APP X
Project : POC
Cost Center : AAZAA


Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level
Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket Level

Virtual path : 
https://july2021.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.txt
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in the bucket name we need to use standard URL : 
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/july.2021/s3.txt

______

Versioning : 

Versioning : HIDE
--> If you delete any object, we will get the Delete Marker. Delete the "Delate Marker" to get the object back to s3 bucket.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete any object, it deletes permanently.

While deleting : If you type
Delete : Creates a Delete Marker.
Permanently delete : Gone

_____

Server access logging : We can enable logs at bucket level. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/LogFormat.html

**Cloudtrail : Data Events : Enable logging for all current buckets/ FUture Buckets.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Life CYcle management Rule : 
--> Apply for entire bucket.
--> Limit the scope : Using "Prefixes" / Tags.

________

SRR / CRR : Same/Cross region replication 
--> Versioning must be enabled in source bucket and destination bucket.
--> If source and destination buckets are in same region we call it as "SRR"
--> If source and destination buckets are in different region we call it as "CRR"
--> Before enabling replication, Whatever the data we have in souce bucket won't replicate automatically. All the future / subsequent uploads will replicate. 

RTC : Replication Time Control replicates 99.99% of new objects within 15 minutes.

Encryption : 

--> In-Transit : SSL / TLS

--> At-Rest / SSE (Server Side Encryption)

	--> SSE-S3 : S3 Generates and Manages the Key material. Whoever have valid access on s3 platform, they can decrypt the data. No additional permissions required on encryption keys.
	--> SSE-KMS (Key Management Service) : 
	--> AWS managed key (aws/s3) : key materail generated and Managed by KMS Service. Whoever have valid access on s3 platform, they can decrypt the data. No additional permissions required on encryption keys.
	--> SSE-KMS (Customer managed keys) : key materail generated and Managed by KMS Service. We need to provide permissions on encyrion key to the IAM user/role to decrypt the data. (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY).

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operations

Alias/Name : 
key administrative permissions : WHo can administrate/manage the key.
Key usage permissions : Who can use this key.

	--> SSE-C (Customer Managed) : key materail generated and Managed by US/End CUstomer, We need to zip the key material and upload it to AWS KMS, We can use as regular KMS key. We need to provide permissions on encyrion key to the IAM user/role to decrypt the data. (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY).

--> CSE (Client Side Encryption) : Whenever customer is not ready to send unencrypted data and Key material.. Customer is responsible for this encryption.

____________________

Static website hosting : Host static website. 
--> Domain name should be same as your bucket name.
--> We should provide atleast read only access on all the data you want to deliver as website.
--> We can configure redirections.

Intelligent-Tiering Archive configurations : 

Archive Access tier : When enabled, Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move objects that haven’t been accessed for a minimum of 90 days to the Archive Access tier.

Deep Archive Access tier : When enabled, Intelligent-Tiering will automatically move objects that haven’t been accessed for a minimum of 180 days to the Deep Archive Access tier.

Event notifications : 

lambda : Serverless : 
SQS Service : msg Queue service : 
SNS : Simple Notification Service : Explain :
