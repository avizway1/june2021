S3 : Simple Storage Service : Object based storage solution. 

Object based storage : We can store flat files. : S3
Block Based storage : We can install the applications and run OS. : EBS, Instance Store
Storage over the network : SAN/NAS : Storage device runs over the network, can be accesable from multiple resources. : EFS, FSx

--> We store all the data in Buckets. 
--> Defaultly we can create 100 buckets in an aws account. (Soft Limit)
--> Bucket Naming standards
	--> Min Char 3 , Max 63 char
	--> Should not contain Upper case letter, Special charater
	--> Should not start with . / end with . / no ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
--> S3 is a global service, Does not required region selection. (IAM also global service)
--> We have unlimited storage in s3.
--> We can upload objects into the bucket.
--> Min Object size : 0 bytes.. Max Object size : 5 TB

How to make data publicly accesable.

Block Public Access settings for this bucket : True


Tags : 
Name : 
Application : APP X
Project : POC
Cost Center : AAZAA


Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level
Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket Level

Virtual path : 
https://july2021.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.txt
https://bucketname.s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/objectname

If we have . in the bucket name we need to use standard URL : 
https://s3.regioncode.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/july.2021/s3.txt

______

Versioning : 

Versioning : HIDE
--> If you delete any object, we will get the Delete Marker. Delete the "Delate Marker" to get the object back to s3 bucket.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete any object, it deletes permanently.

While deleting : If you type
Delete : Creates a Delete Marker.
Permanently delete : Gone

_____

Server access logging : We can enable logs at bucket level. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/LogFormat.html

**Cloudtrail : Data Events : Enable logging for all current buckets/ FUture Buckets.
