EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud :  Instance = Server

Pay-as-you-go : 


On-Demand ec2 instance : When we have Unpredictable workloads, Testing for the first time.. 
Pricing : /Sec (Min of 60 Sec) / /hr
__

Reserved ec2 Instances : When our workload is stable and predictable.. For longer durations.. We need to reserve the capacity for 1 Yr/3 yrs.

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration during the period.
	COnvertable RI : We can change the configuration. (upgrade)
	Scheduled RI : If we have persistent / repeated requests. 
Pricing : 
	Full upfront : Pay 100% as onetime.
	Partial upfront : Pay 30-50% as onetime, THen remaining amount on monthly basis with redused hrly price.
	No Upfront : Pay everything monthly basis.

--> We can sell RI instances in AWS MarketPlace.
__
Spot ec2 instances : When we have flexible start/stop durations.. No critical data/application is delivering.. Test/UAT.. Bid your price against the aws pricing. 

--> If your quoted price is more than or equal to aws price, we will get an EC2 instance.
--> If price increased aws will Terminate our ec2 instance.

If price increased AWS termnated instance, we need to pay only completed billing hours.
If price not increased YOU termnated instance, we need to pay for full usage hours.

1 hr 30 Min : AWS terminated : 1 Hr
1 Hr 30 Min : YOU terminated : 1 Hr 30 Min

--> N Virginia

Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	: Operating System : Windows server 2016 base (Server class OS): 

Windows : 
	
Step 2 : Choose an Instance type 		: vCPU, Memory(RAM), Network perf
__


General Purpose : Stable/balanced performance of compute, memory and network resources.
Type : t2, t3, m5

Compute Optimized : We will get more CPU performances from these instances. We will have high perf processors in these instances.
Type : c4, c5, c6  (Compute / CPU)

Memory Optimized : We will get more RAM perf. Workloads required to process large set of data via memory.
Type : r4, r5, r6, x1, z1 (RAM)

GPU Optimized / Accelerated computing : We will get more graphic processings, Efficient for data pattern matching, High level gaming.
Type : p2, p3, p4, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : we will get more Storage/ Hard Disk performance. FOr the application required more IOPS, we use this types.
Type : d2, d3, i3

IOPS : Input and Output operations per second

m5.large	: 2 CPU, 8 RAM
c5.xlarge	: 4 cpu, 8 ram
t3.medium	: 2 cpu, 4 ram

Maintenance windows : Sat 06 AM IST..

Step 3 : Configure additional settings
	VPC, ROles, userdata

	Instance Termination protection : Enable
	Shutdown behaviour : STOP

Step 4 : Choose storage

	root volume : volume that contains Operating system : 30 gb for windows

Step 5 : Add Tags : COmbination of Key and Value pairs.

Name : 
Project : 
Platform : Windows / Linux
COst center : AAZAA

Step 6: Configure Security Group : Security group acts as Firewall at Instance level.

OS Ports/protocols : 0 - 65535

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 
Linux : SSH : 22
Webserver : http : 80
Secure web : https : 443

source : From where you want to connect to this instance.
MyIP : 
Custom : 
Anywhere : 

Step 7 : Review and launch with keypair.

Keypair : Key pair contains public key and private key. (.pem)

AWS Holds the Public Key.
Customer/WE holdes the Private key.


COnnect to Windows Instance :

--> Open "run" , type "mstsc" , CLick enter.. Provide instance "Public IP/DNS".
--> Choose instance "connect', choose "RDP Client", "Download remote desktop file"

MAC : https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12


start/stop : 10 days work.. 1 month.. : Stop, Start the server
Terminate : Delete the server..


Task : Launch windows ec2 instance and using keypair get connect to ec2 instance.

Task 2 : CHange the password of "Administrator", Disconnect from the instance. Now try to login to ec2 instance using "keypair pwd" , "Custom password". whichone is working..??

Task 3 : Create a user in ec2 instance provide him "Local administrator rights", also provide him "Remote desktop permissions".. Take a session with this user along with administrator.


For a windows server, at a time 2 users can connect to the instance. 

Public IP / DNS : Unique across the globe : works over the internet 
Private IP : unique withi the network : works with in the network 

.pem : Private enhanced Mail certificte

EC2 Pricing : 
1. How many hrs our server is running. (t2.micro: 750 Hrs/Month)
2. How much volume size is provised and associated to instance. (30 gb)

FREE TIER : 750 Hrs/Month t2.micro windows instance (ondemand)
750 Hrs/Month t2.micro Linux instance (ondemand)
