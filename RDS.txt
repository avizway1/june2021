RDS : Relational Database Service : 6 Relational db engines.
--> Amazon Aurora	(Mysql COmpatable / postgresql Compatable)
--> MySQL
--> MS SQL
--> PostgreSQL
--> MariaDB
--> Oracle

NoSQL database : IN AWS DynamoDB is a Serverless architecture.
--> DynamoDB : 

Caching solution for DynamoDB : DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)
Caching for RDS : Elasticache (2 Open SOurce caching engines)
	--> MemcacheD
	--> Redis

DMS : Database Migration Service

Homogenious Migration : OnPrem MYSQL --> DMS Cluster --> AWS RDS MYSQL
Heterogenious migration : OnPrem DB2 --> SCT --> DMS Cluster --> AWS RDS MYSQL

--> Similar to Mongodb , AWS have a service "Document db". 

______

ec2 instance --> OS Level --> Install anything --> We have to take care below things.
Licensing..??
UPgradations..?? 
Backup..??
HA/FT..??

RDS --> Everything managed by AWS.

--> We won't get any choice to login to OS level.

GUI tools to manage the Databases : 
--> Amazon Aurora : Mysql Workbench / pgadmin
--> MySQL	: Mysql Workbench
--> MS SQL	: ssms (Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio)
--> PostgreSQL	: pgadmin
--> MariaDB	: workbench
--> Oracle	: oracle tool, Toad

Enable Public Access : Yes .. DB can be accesable over the internet, We can install tools in local device and connect. 
NO : The DB instance will be available to the resources running in same VPC.


--> DB ENgine 
--> Define Username and password (admin & custom/autogenerated)
--> Storage option
--> VPC (Default)

Version : -2 / -1 mechanism.. We don't go with latest version. 
Free Tier : Choose this
Credentials : Define Username and password (admin & custom/autogenerated)
DB Instance class : db.t2.micro
Storage : Min 20gb, Max: 16TB	: 20 GB (Free Tier)

Storage Autoscaling : AWS will add storage automatically when the existing size is 80%.
	--> 10% of existing storage
	--> 5 GB .. WHich ever is higher, AWS choose it.

COnnectivity : 
VPC : Default
Public Access : YES
Port : 3306

Automatic Backup : AWS creates backups automatically.  : Disable
0 --> disable
1 --> Min 
35 --> Max

--> We will get DB Endpoint to connect to db instance. We won;t get any IP address for this db instance. 


Task : Launch an Mysql RDS db instance in CUstomVPCs Public SUbnet. Install Mysql workbench and connect to the RDS db instance.  
(Launch an ec2 instance and install mysql workbench, connect to rds db..)

MultiAZ Deployment : Designed for Failover/FT purpose. 

Automated Backup : This feature creates bacjup copies of our RDS instances automatically.  Based on retention period, we can have backup copies in our aws env to restore. 
Disable : 0 
Min : 1 Day
Max : 35 Days

--> When we are launching db instance, it creates a backup copy automatically, if this feature is enabled. 

7 Days : AWS keeps last 7 days backup copies. 


Enhanced Monitoring : 1 Sec
Basic Monitoring : 5 Min

____

We have "Read Replica" option for scaling purpose. It works with "Master-Slave" mechanism.

Manual Snapshots : We can create snapshots manually. These won't delete along with rds db instance.  We need to delete manually.

Automated/system snapshots : AWS creates these, We cannot delete these.


RDS won't work on In-Place restoration. Restoration happens as a new rds db instance with new endpoint.

Restore to point in time : You are creating a new DB instance from a source DB instance at a specified time.

___

Dynamodb : nosql database : Serverless architecture. : single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. 

Now you can select, insert, update, and delete data in DynamoDB. using ad hoc PartiQL queries.

Task : launch an rds mysql db instance-1.. Now export/restore the shared db... 

Launch another rds mysql db instance-2.. Migrate all the datbases and tables from Db instance-1 to db instance-2 Using DMS (Database Migration service).


1. Launch a DMS cluster
2. Create endpoints (Source and destination) and test the endpoints
3. Create a replciation job and verify.
